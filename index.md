# Welcome to the MORPHOS Lab

We study how water, sediment, and landscapes interact in coastal and delta environments.

Our research explores:
- How rivers, tides, and waves shape deltas
- How floodplains connect with coasts
- How storms and sea level affect flooding
- How to model and predict coastal change

We combine science and engineering to solve real-world problems like:
- Coastal flooding
- Erosion
- Ecosystem resilience 

More sections coming soon!
